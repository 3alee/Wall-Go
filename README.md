# Wall-Go

Season 2 of the South Korean reality game show "Devil's Plan" introduced a simple variation on the game Go, aptly named **Wall Go**. For fans out there who desperately wanted to try out the game for themselves, I developed a quick **cross-platform app** using Tauri, which should be **downloadable** for MacOS, Linus and Windows. I have personally tested out the MacOS and Windows builds, though the Linux one should work regardless.

If you'd prefer a **playable online version**, I've also created one too: https://3alee.github.io/wall-go-wasm/

Currently, wall breaking has not been added as a feature, and player vs computer matches have yet to be introduced.

## Wall Go by other Coders 

I was partially inspired by some other guys who tried their hand at recreating the game as well
