# Wall-Go

Season 2 of the South Korean reality game show "Devil's Plan" introduced a simple variation on the game Go, aptly named Wall Go. For fans out there who desperately wanted to try out the game for themselves, I developed a quick cross-platform app using Tauri, which should be accessible on both MacOS, Linus and Windows.

## Gameplay

Currently, wall breaking has not been added as a feature, and player vs computer matches have yet to be introduced.

## Inspiration

I was partially inspired by some other guys who tried their hand at recreating the game as well, which is accessible in-browser and doesn't require a download. At the time of writing, their version isn't quite as complete, but is certainly improving: https://www.wallgoal.com/
